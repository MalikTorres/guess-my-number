## Guess My Number Game

Welcome to the Guess My Number Game! This is a basic JavaScript game where the player tries to guess the correct number within a specified range.

### How to Play
The game generates a random secret number between 1 and 20.

Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Check" button.

You'll receive feedback on your guess:

If your guess is correct, you win!
If your guess is too high, you'll be notified to guess lower.
If your guess is too low, you'll be prompted to guess higher.
Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or run out of attempts.

Your current score is displayed, and you can see your high score, which is the best score you achieved in a single game.
